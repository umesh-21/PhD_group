\section{Problem Statement} \label{sec:problem statement}
The task of language production, particularly in low-resource circumstances where there is little or no paired data available for training, is the problem that our study attempts to solve. In our work, we are using an encoder-decoder framework to put a sentence fragment back together given the parts that are left. The aim is to train the encoder and decoder to enhance their ability to extract representations and model languages.
